- why you don't use aiofiles for sync insted of filez --- or work with filz as legacy code % okay apply the true lib 

- the same thing with aiobotocore must use it insted of boto for non blocking mechansiem  % the same answer 

- why in cvprocess you make await oon the work with database why didn't use create task like s3 beaucse here we don't  need the rsult from the database 

- 


--------------------------------
for me:


will use async.createtask with start point of the program beacuse this is like detach to  start all tasks 

and using async and await 



******
How to  apply:

1- make any method or function async function  
2- make any object inside this function take time to do somthings await beacuse this is awaitable object 
3- using the own async function to help us 
4- Apply lock for the cretical objects and apply safe thread 

-------------
notes for applaing - from tutorial : 

apply await for task when we need the function result before we leave this area --- but here may goes
to another task but the current task will never contained before we done the result of the await line

so wait will make the current function or coroutine pused 


apply asyncio.create_task(...) when we don't care about the function result for the next line of the code 
but here will cont. in the same task to the next line 
-------------
note from ahmed 

1- search for shield to protect the code with await from cancelation 
2- aiboto3
